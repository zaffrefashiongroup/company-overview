# About Us

Zaffre Fashion Group (ZFG) is a leading high-end fashion house headquartered in Gravity Falls, OR. Our company provides a boutique brick and click experience for each of our product lines.

Our fashion house was built on our flagship brand, Mabel, a high-end clothier that has garnered a cult following over the last 25 years for its curated fashion experience. The company has since expanded into multiple brands across several business units. 

The Mabel eCommerce, the primary storefront application stack, was originally built on-premises. Cloud-first efforts began in 2017 using cloud for archive and long-term data retention. A number of applications, including Mabel eCommerce, have since been shifted to cloud. Modernization efforts are ongoing.

Our company consists of 4 technology business units (BUs):

* Corporate IT - manages systems that are used company wide, with strategic business unit oversight
  * Led by CIO, David Lee
* Mabel BU - manages all IT services required for Mabel label production, e-Commerce, and brick & mortar services
  * Flagship brand, launched in 1995
  * Led by MBU IT Director, Stan Pines
* Haverford BU - manages all IT services required for Haverford label production, e-Commerce, and brick & mortar services
  * Second line of business, acquired in 2018
  * Lead by HBU IT Director, Anne Perkins
* Jed BU - manages all IT services required for Jed label production, e-Commerce, and brick & mortar services
  * Third line of business, launched in 2020
